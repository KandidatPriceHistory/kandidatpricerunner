Welcome to our PriceRunnerHistory web application !

You can visit the web application by entering http://www.pricehistoryapp.herokuapp.com. The web application may be in 'sleep 
mode' (since it is a free version of Heroku) and then it can take up to 30 seconds to enter the application.

If you want to run the web application locally in development mode, run the command $npm run dev in your terminal
